# PraktikumWebB
The PraktikumWebB repository is an assignment for a basic web development course at my campus. The final project of this course is to create a website that implements CRUD using native php. In the final project, my group created the Acraf website which is a simple e-commerce website specifically for handicrafts. For more details, you can see our simple project in the [UAS](https://github.com/arisurya7/PraktikumWebB/tree/master/UAS) folder or visit the [Acraf Website](http://acraf.epizy.com).
